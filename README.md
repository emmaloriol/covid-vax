# covid-vax


Introduction:

We are answering the questions of “What states have the most/least access to vaccine providers?”, “What states are the most/least vaccinated?”, and ”What are the death rates from COVID by state?”. 
Overall, we are trying to assess if there is a relationship between the variables of vaccine provider density, vaccination rate, and COVID-19 death rates by state. These are important questions 
because they give insight to levels of access to vaccination by state and the effect that may have on vaccination rate, which is a critical measure of pandemic response and preparedness. 
These are the initial questions we are investigating, but we may expand our scope depending on what the data elucidates.
